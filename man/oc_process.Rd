\title{Process OpenCage geocoding request}
\usage{
oc_process(placename = NULL, latitude = NULL, longitude = NULL,
  key = oc_key(), return = "url_only", bounds = NULL,
  proximity = NULL, countrycode = NULL, language = NULL,
  limit = 1L, min_confidence = NULL, no_annotations = TRUE,
  no_dedupe = FALSE, no_record = FALSE, abbrv = FALSE,
  add_request = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{placename}{A character vector with the placename(s) to be geocoded.
Required. If the placename(s) is/are address(es), see
\href{https://github.com/OpenCageData/opencagedata-misc-docs/blob/master/query-formatting.md}{OpenCage's
 instructions} on how to format addresses for forward geocoding best.}

\item{key}{Your OpenCage API key as a character vector of length one.
Required. By default, \code{\link{oc_key}} will attempt to retrieve the key
from the environment variable \code{OPENCAGE_KEY}.}

\item{return}{A character vector of length one indicating the return value of
the function, either a list of tibbles (\code{df_list}, the default), a
JSON list (\code{json_list}), a GeoJSON list (\code{geojson_list}), or the
URL with which the API would be called (\code{url_only}).}

\item{bounds}{A list of bounding boxes, i.e. numeric vectors, each with 4
coordinates forming the south-west and north-east corners of a bounding box
\code{list(c(xmin, ymin, xmax, ymax))}. The \code{bounds} parameter will
restrict the possible results to the supplied region. It can easily be
specified with the \code{\link{oc_bbox}} helper, for example like
\code{bounds = oc_bbox(-0.563160, 51.280430, 0.278970, 51.683979)}.}

\item{proximity}{A list of bounding boxes, i.e. numeric vectors, each with
with latitude, longitude coordinates in decimal format. They provide
OpenCage with a hint to bias results in favour of those closer to the
specified location. It can easily be specified with the
\code{\link{oc_points}} helper, for example like \code{proximity =
oc_points(41.40139,2.12870)}.}

\item{countrycode}{A two letter code as defined by the
\href{https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#search/code}{ISO 3166-1 Alpha 2} standard
that restricts the results to the given country or countries. E.g. "AR" for
Argentina, "FR" for France, "NZ" for the New Zealand. Multiple countrycodes
per \code{placename} must be wrapped in a list.}

\item{language}{An
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IETF_language_tag}{IETF language tag}
(such as "es" for Spanish or "pt-BR" for Brazilian Portuguese). OpenCage
will attempt to return results in that language. If it is not specified,
"en" (English) will be assumed by the API.}

\item{limit}{The maximum number of results that should be returned. Integer
values between 1 and 100 are allowed, the default is 1.}

\item{min_confidence}{An integer value between 0 and 10 indicating the
precision of the returned result as defined by its geographical extent,
(i.e. by the extent of the result's bounding box). See the
\href{https://opencagedata.com/api#confidence}{API documentation} for
details. Only results with at least the requested confidence will be
returned.}

\item{no_annotations}{A logical vector indicating whether additional
information about the result location should be returned. \code{TRUE} by
default, which means that the output will not contain annotations.}

\item{no_dedupe}{A logical vector (default \code{FALSE}), when \code{TRUE}
the output will not be deduplicated.}

\item{no_record}{A logical vector (default \code{FALSE}), when \code{TRUE} no
log entry of the query is created and the geocoding request is not cached
by OpenCage.}

\item{abbrv}{A logical vector (default \code{FALSE}), when \code{TRUE}
addresses in the \code{formatted} field of the results are abbreviated
(e.g. "Main St." instead of "Main Street").}

\item{add_request}{A logical vector (default \code{FALSE}) indicating whether
the request is returned again with the results. If the \code{return} value
is a \code{df_list}, the query text is added as a column to the results.
\code{json_list} results will contain all request parameters, including the
API key used! For \code{geojson_list} this is currently ignored by
OpenCage.}
}
\value{
\code{oc_forward} returns, depending on the \code{return} parameter,
  a list with either
  \itemize{
  \item the results as tibbles (\code{"df_list"}, the default),
  \item the results as JSON lists (\code{"json_list"}),
  \item the results as GeoJSON lists (\code{"geojson_list"}), or
  \item the URL of the OpenCage API call for debugging purposes
  (\code{"url_only"}).
  }
}
\description{
This function processes all geocoding requests issued by
\code{\link{oc_forward}} and \code{\link{oc_reverse}} by calling the
respective functions (after the query arguments have been checked by
\code{\link{oc_check_query}}). It builds the URL, fetches the results,
checks the status of the returned results and finally parses them.
