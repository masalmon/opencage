\usage{
oc_forward_df(data, placename, bind_cols = TRUE, output = c("short",
  "all"), key = oc_key(), proximity = NULL, bounds = NULL,
  countrycode = NULL, language = NULL, limit = 1L,
  min_confidence = NULL, no_annotations = TRUE, no_dedupe = FALSE,
  no_record = FALSE, abbrv = FALSE, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame.}

\item{placename}{An unquoted variable name of a character vector with the
  placenames to be geocoded.

  If the placenames are addresses, see
  \href{https://github.com/OpenCageData/opencagedata-misc-docs/blob/master/query-formatting.md}{OpenCage's
   instructions} on how to format addresses for best forward geocoding
   results.}

\item{bind_cols}{When \code{bind_col = TRUE}, the default, the results are
column bound to \code{data}. When \code{FALSE}, the results are returned as
a new tibble.}

\item{output}{A character vector of length one indicating whether only
latitude, longitude, and formatted address variables (\code{"short"}, the
default) should be returned or all variables (\code{"all"}) variables
should be returned.}

\item{key}{Your OpenCage API key as a character vector of length one. By
default, \code{\link{oc_key}} will attempt to retrieve the key from the
environment variable \code{OPENCAGE_KEY}.}

\item{proximity}{A list of length one, or an unquoted variable name of a list
column of points. Points are named numeric vectors with latitude, longitude
coordinate pairs in decimal format. \code{proximity} provides OpenCage with
a hint to bias results in favour of those closer to the specified location.
It can be specified with the \code{\link{oc_points}} helper. For example:
\code{proximity = oc_points(41.40139, 2.12870)}. Default is \code{NULL}.}

\item{bounds}{A list of length one, or an unquoted variable name of a list
column of bounding boxes. Bounding boxes are named numeric vectors, each
with 4 coordinates forming the south-west and north-east corners of the
bounding box: \code{list(c(xmin, ymin, xmax, ymax))}. \code{bounds}
restricts the possible results to the supplied region. It can be specified
with the \code{\link{oc_bbox}} helper. For example: \code{bounds =
oc_bbox(-0.563160, 51.280430, 0.278970, 51.683979)}. Default is
\code{NULL}.}

\item{countrycode}{Character vector, or an unquoted variable name of such a
vector, of two-letter codes as defined by the
\href{https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#search/code}{ISO 3166-1 Alpha 2} standard
that restricts the results to the given country or countries. E.g. "AR" for
Argentina, "FR" for France, "NZ" for the New Zealand. Multiple countrycodes
per \code{placename} must be wrapped in a list. Default is \code{NULL}.}

\item{language}{Character vector, or an unquoted variable name of such a
vector, of \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IETF_language_tag}{IETF BCP
47 language tags} (such as "es" for Spanish or "pt-BR" for Brazilian
Portuguese). OpenCage will attempt to return results in that language.
Alternatively you can specify the "native" tag, in which case OpenCage will
attempt to return the response in the "official" language(s). In case the
`language` parameter is set to `NULL` (which is the default), the tag is
not recognized, or OpenCage does not have a record in that language, the
results will be returned in English.}

\item{limit}{Numeric vector of integer values, or an unquoted variable name
of such a vector, to determine the maximum number of results returned for
each \code{placename}. Integer values between 1 and 100 are allowed.
Default is 1.}

\item{min_confidence}{Numeric vector of integer values, or an unquoted
variable name of such a vector, between 0 and 10 indicating the precision
of the returned result as defined by its geographical extent, (i.e. by the
extent of the result's bounding box). See the
\href{https://opencagedata.com/api#confidence}{API documentation} for
details. Only results with at least the requested confidence will be
returned. Default is \code{NULL}).}

\item{no_annotations}{Logical vector, or an unquoted variable name of such a
vector, indicating whether additional information about the result location
should be returned. Default is \code{TRUE}, which means that the output
will not contain annotations.}

\item{no_dedupe}{Logical vector, or an unquoted variable name of such a
vector. Default is \code{FALSE}. When \code{TRUE} the output will not be
deduplicated.}

\item{no_record}{Logical vector of length one (default \code{FALSE}), when
\code{TRUE} no log entry of the query is created, and the geocoding
request is not cached by OpenCage.}

\item{abbrv}{Logical vector, or an unquoted variable name of such a
vector. Default is \code{FALSE}. When \code{TRUE} addresses in the
\code{formatted} variable of the results are abbreviated (e.g. "Main St."
instead of "Main Street").}

\item{...}{Ignored.}

  limit = 1:3,
  countrycode = c("ca", "us", "co"),
  language = c("fr", "de", "en"))

# Use the bounds column to help return accurate results and
# language column to specify preferred language of results
oc_forward_df(df2, placename = locations,
              bounds = bounds,
              language = language)

# Different limit of results for each placename
