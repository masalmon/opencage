\title{Reverse geocoding}
\usage{
opencage_reverse(latitude, longitude, key = oc_key(), bounds = NULL,
  countrycode = NULL, language = NULL, limit = 10,
  min_confidence = NULL, no_annotations = FALSE, no_dedupe = FALSE,
  no_record = FALSE, abbrv = FALSE, add_request = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{latitude}{A numeric vector with the latitude. Required.}

\item{longitude}{A numeric vector with the longitude. Required.}

\item{key}{Your OpenCage API key as a character vector of length one.
Required. By default, \code{\link{oc_key}} will attempt to retrieve the key
from the environment variable \code{OPENCAGE_KEY}.}

\item{bounds}{Bounding box, ignored for reverse geocoding.}

\item{countrycode}{Country code, ignored for reverse geocoding.}

\item{language}{An
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IETF_language_tag}{IETF language tag}
(such as "es" for Spanish or "pt-BR" for Brazilian Portuguese). OpenCage
will attempt to return results in that language. If it is not specified,
"en" (English) will be assumed by the API.}

\item{limit}{How many results should be returned (1-100), ignored for reverse
geocoding.}

\item{min_confidence}{An integer value between 0 and 10 indicating the
precision of the returned result as defined by its geographical extent,
(i.e. by the extent of the result's bounding box). See the
\href{https://opencagedata.com/api#confidence}{API documentation} for
details. Only results with at least the requested confidence will be
returned.}

\item{no_annotations}{A logical vector indicating whether additional
information about the result location should be returned. \code{TRUE} by
default, which means that the output will not contain annotations.}

\item{no_dedupe}{A logical vector (default \code{FALSE}), when \code{TRUE}
the output will not be deduplicated.}

\item{no_record}{A logical vector (default \code{FALSE}), when \code{TRUE} no
log entry of the query is created and the geocoding request is not cached
by OpenCage.}

\item{abbrv}{A logical vector (default \code{FALSE}), when \code{TRUE}
addresses in the \code{formatted} field of the results are abbreviated
(e.g. "Main St." instead of "Main Street").}

\item{add_request}{A logical vector (default \code{FALSE}) indicating whether
the request is returned again with the results. If the \code{return} value
is a \code{df_list}, the query text is added as a column to the results.
\code{json_list} results will contain all request parameters, including the
API key used! For \code{geojson_list} this is currently ignored by
OpenCage.}
}
\value{
A list with
\itemize{
\item results as a data.frame (`dplyr` `tbl_df`) called results with one line
 per results,
\item the number of results as an integer,
\item the timestamp as a POSIXct object,
\item rate_info data.frame (`dplyr` `tbl_df`) with the maximal number
of API calls  per day for the used key, the number of remaining calls
for the day and the time at which the number of remaining calls will
 be reset.
